# Arduino-AD8307-RF-Power-Meter
I drew this with EASYCAD in my spare time. I plan to use ad8307 to make a simple power meter. Of course, Arduino is the best choice for handling control and display affairs. This is the first version, there may still be problems, and the program has not been written yet.please be patient. I will make improvements based on the test results soon.
